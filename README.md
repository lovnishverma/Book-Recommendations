## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**

   * Loads Goodreads dataset and cleans invalid entries.
   * Converts numeric fields and calculates additional features like popularity scores, rating distribution, and decade.

2. **Hybrid Recommendation**

   * **Semantic search:** Sentence Transformer embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for content similarity.
   * **Keyword search:** TF-IDF vectorization of book titles, authors, and combined text.
   * **Scoring:** Weighted sum of semantic, keyword, popularity, rating, and rating distribution scores.

3. **Filtering**

   * User-defined filters for rating, popularity, publication year, and author.

4. **Output**

   * Returns top recommendations with detailed book info, cover image, match score, and explanation.
